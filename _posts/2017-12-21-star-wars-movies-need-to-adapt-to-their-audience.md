While watching “Star Trek: Beyond,” I began to think a little bit about how much the recent “Star Trek” have borrowed from Star Wars. Indeed, the first movie in the rebooted version of Star Trek has been described as taking many elements from Star Wars.

This is a shift from Star Trek’s best strengths. Original episodes often tackled significant topics and action was secondary. This changed when Star Trek came back in the late 70’s and 80’s as a movie, where the stories needed to be far more action packed.

“Star Trek: Discovery” represents a course correction for the Star Trek franchise. They going back to their roots in a way, while also trying a few new things (for example, new Klingons). It isn’t classic Trek, but the series is driven more by characters and story than action.

“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is experiencing an identity crises that is very similar to the one Star Trek is going through. As a long time fan of Star Wars, I expect a little bit of my childhood each time I watch a new film. But, how realistic is that? I don’t watch movies in the same way that I did when I was eight years old.

The challenge for Star Wars is that they need to satisfy a very wide audience: old fans, new fans, young fans, and (as unbelievable as it sounds) the portion of the audience that has never seen a Star Wars movie. What is the saying? That you can please some of the people all of the time? They’ve already heard from fans who weren’t pleased by “The Last Jedi.”

As movies go, “The Last Jedi” isn’t bad. There have definitely been worse. It also isn’t the worst of Star Wars movies. But, it has a peculiar set of flaws that I think distract from its strengths.

I think the source of the problems with these latest “Star Wars” movies is that they are trying too hard to follow the templates laid out by the original trilogy, and then later the prequels. What they really should do is to try to find a way to redefine what a Star Wars movie really should be in the modern age. They could take a page from the plan the producers of “Star Trek: Discovery” are following.
